DESCRIPTION

The code runs Cross-Domain-PG-ELLA over two domains conformed by the Simple Mass (SM) and Double-Mass (DM) systems. Each domain contains two randomly parameterized tasks for a total of four tasks to be observed. The SM and DM systems are illustrated below.

BUILDING

The Cross-Domain-PG-ELLA code is written in pure matlab and thus does not need to be built.
However, Cross-Domain PG-ELLA does have a dependency on the Sparse Additive Modeling Toolbox of
Julien Mairal et al. (http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/).  In order to use
Cross-Domain PG-ELLA one must first go to the subdirectory 'externalLibs/spams-matlab' and
follow the instructions for building this toolbox.


RUNNING THE CODE

We have included one demo for utilizing the different aspects of the Cross-Domain PG-ELLA
software.  The demo file is called ‘CrossDomainSavedData.m’. The calculation of theta* has been carried out previously. The file ‘Data.mat’ contains al the parameters used to calculate theta* and the relevant ones are shown in the command window during the execution.
